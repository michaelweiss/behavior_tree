# behavior_tree

This is a minimal implementation of a behavior tree. It is not meant to be a full implementation of the behavior tree paradigm, but rather to learn about behavior trees and to create a wrapper around other implementations with a common interface.

## Example

`robot.py` is a simple example of a robot that can move around and pick up objects.
